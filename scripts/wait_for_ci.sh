# Poll GitHub Actions for the latest push's CI run + report result. Use after
# `git push` when you want to know the CI outcome before moving on — for this
# repo that means BEFORE running `pio run` locally + OTA-pushing to the fleet.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/wait_for_ci.sh            # wait for the latest run on the current branch
#   bash scripts/wait_for_ci.sh --timeout 600
#
# Requires: gh CLI authenticated to dblagbro/rebooter-firmware.
#
# 2026-07-08 — ported from rebooter-droids/scripts/wait_for_ci.sh (which
# itself was ported from devingpt after the v0.6.56 4-day-red-CI incident).
# Rebooter-firmware previously had no CI at all; the .github/workflows/ci.yml
# in the same commit adds it. This script is the discipline gate: run it
# after every push, before OTA-flashing the fleet.
