Subject: Cold-start dossier — exact current state, full context, blockers, delays owned, and help requested

## Purpose of This Document

This document is intended to be strong enough that:

- a new operator,
- a new engineer,
- or a fresh model session with zero memory

can pick it up and continue the project safely without relying on hidden context.

This is **not** a short update. It is a continuity packet.

If you only read one thing, read:

1. **Current live state**
2. **Known stable operating mode**
3. **What is actually blocked**
4. **What firmware has already tried**
5. **What help is explicitly requested from Rebooter-Droids**
6. **Exact commands / artifacts / file paths**

## Current Environment Snapshot

### Local repo paths on this workstation

- Firmware repo:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-firmware`
- Hub/backend repo:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-droids-publish`

Notes:

- Do **not** assume `S:\code\rebooter-droids` is mounted in every shell/session.
- On this workstation, the usable hub repo path during this handoff was
  `C:\dev\rebooter-droids-publish`.

### Git revisions at handoff time

- Firmware repo HEAD:
  - `fd3dfc3`
- Hub repo HEAD:
  - `e0db940`

### Current built firmware artifact

- Path:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\.pio\build\sonoff_s31\firmware.bin`
- Version:
  - `0.1.40-dev-central-safe`
- SHA256:
  - `EB7E6CB1688675DC3FE031640A0C1448D071C82B0B72C0B76169DA5A48B5E8BF`

### Known working local device auth

- Header name:
  - `X-Rebooter-Auth`
- Known working password on the reachable bench/wall devices:
  - `BenchPass123!`
- Username typically used locally:
  - `admin`

Important:

- Passwords are not readable back out of devices in plaintext.
- `BenchPass123!` is the known working value verified during this run against
  protected endpoints on the reachable LAN devices.

## Operator / Physical Constraints

These constraints are operationally important and must be respected.

1. The devices `.67`, `.69`, `.30`, and `.225` are back together and in the wall.
2. The user explicitly asked to avoid any path that would require reopening them.
3. `.48` is the only device still effectively usable as a bench/control device.
4. Do **not** change the workstation Wi-Fi unless the user explicitly asks.
5. Prefer LAN-only recovery and OTA for wall devices.
6. Do not treat wall devices as disposable repro targets.

## Device Inventory — Current Live State

Fresh status sweep immediately before writing this dossier:

### `.48` — bench/control

- IP: `192.168.1.48`
- Name: `Rebooter - renamed test`
- Firmware: `0.1.37-dev-central-safe`
- `recovery_mode=false`
- `health_state=healthy`
- `central_state=idle`
- `central_registered=true`
- `power_enabled=true`
- `wifi_connected=true`
- `reset_reason=Software/System restart`
- `free_heap=23000`
- `uptime_seconds=182962`

Interpretation:

- This is the healthiest control device.
- It is still the main bench/reference node.
- It remains the best place to prove new firmware behavior before touching wall devices.

### `.67` — wall device

- IP: `192.168.1.67`
- Name: `Erica's F.L Speaker`
- Firmware: `0.1.40-dev-central-safe`
- `recovery_mode=false`
- `health_state=healthy`
- `central_state=heartbeat_ok`
- `central_registered=true`
- `power_enabled=false`
- `wifi_connected=true`
- `reset_reason=Exception`
- `free_heap=16216`
- `uptime_seconds=2196`

Interpretation:

- Currently online and healthy.
- Central registration is working.
- Still carries `reset_reason=Exception` from its last reboot history, so do not
  over-interpret it as "clean forever," but it is in the presently validated safe mode.

### `.69` — wall device

- IP: `192.168.1.69`
- Name: `Erica's R.L. Speaker`
- Firmware: `0.1.40-dev-central-safe`
- `recovery_mode=false`
- `health_state=healthy`
- `central_state=idle`
- `central_registered=true`
- `power_enabled=false`
- `wifi_connected=true`
- `reset_reason=Exception`
- `free_heap=16248`
- `uptime_seconds=286`

Interpretation:

- Online and healthy at the moment of capture.
- Recently rebooted, which is why uptime is low.
- Still in the safe mode (`power=false`) that is currently trusted.

### `.30` — wall device

- IP: `192.168.1.30`
- Name: `Rebooter`
- Firmware: `0.1.40-dev-central-safe`
- `recovery_mode=false`
- `health_state=healthy`
- `central_state=idle`
- `central_registered=true`
- `power_enabled=false`
- `wifi_connected=true`
- `reset_reason=Exception`
- `free_heap=16120`
- `uptime_seconds=2057`

Interpretation:

- Online and healthy.
- Cleared out of its earlier recovery state via LAN OTA.

### `.225` — wall device

- IP: `192.168.1.225`
- Name: `Erica's F.R Speaker`
- Firmware: `0.1.40-dev-central-safe`
- `recovery_mode=false`
- `health_state=unknown`
- `central_state=boot_warmup`
- `central_registered=true`
- `power_enabled=false`
- `wifi_connected=true`
- `reset_reason=Exception`
- `free_heap=16680`
- `uptime_seconds=5`

Interpretation:

- At the instant of the fresh sweep, `.225` had just rebooted and was still in boot warmup.
- This matters: the fleet is improved, but not "problem fully solved."
- `.225` had previously been healthy/registered in this same safe mode, but it is
  still the least-settled of the wall devices.

## Known Safer Operating Mode

The currently **safer** operating mode for the in-wall ESP8266 devices is:

- `central=true`
- `power=false`

This is not theoretical. It was established through:

- split testing
- LAN-only reconfiguration
- OTA upgrades to `0.1.40`
- a short wall-device soak

Important correction:

- this mode is **safer than `power=true`**
- but it is **not yet proven production-stable across the whole wall fleet**

It is still the best currently available non-invasive operating mode and has
allowed the project to keep moving **without** opening the wall devices again.

## What Is Not Yet Stable Enough

The currently untrusted / blocked mode for low-heap ESP8266 Sonoff S31 devices is:

- `central=true`
- `power=true`

Specifically, the suspect path is the standalone HTTPS power upload flow:

- `POST /device/power-samples`

This is the clearest blocked path, but it is not the only remaining problem.

Late-session watch data on 2026-05-19 showed that even with `power=false`,
some wall devices are still rebooting with `reset_reason=Exception`.

So the current honest position is:

- `power=true` is clearly unsafe on low-heap wall ESP8266 devices
- `power=false` is safer and operationally usable
- `power=false` is still **not** fully stable enough to call the job done

## Problem Statement — Narrowed Technical Blocker

The problem is no longer best described as "devices are unstable."

The best current problem statement is:

> Low-heap ESP8266 wall devices are significantly more survivable with
> `central=true, power=false`, but the fleet is still showing Exception-driven
> reboots, and the current standalone HTTPS power-upload path is clearly unsafe
> enough that it should not be used on the in-wall S31s yet.

This means:

- hub-connected smart/rebooter behavior is substantially recovered
- production-capable power telemetry on these constrained in-wall units is not yet recovered
- long-run reboot stability is improved but still not fully solved

## What Firmware Has Already Tried

This section matters because it prevents repetition and false optimism.

### Central-client / stability mitigations attempted

The following were implemented or tested in the firmware line during this effort:

- wider backoff after repeated transport failures
- less aggressive heartbeat/poll/firmware-check/power-upload overlap
- event-log early-boot quieting
- suppression of repetitive failure-log churn
- compact heartbeat payloads
- compact power payloads
- no-response power POST path
- cleaner power-upload rescheduling
- coalesced/deferred event-log persistence
- mitigation around boot-time `reported_config` heartbeat behavior

These were not useless.

What they accomplished:

- they narrowed the bug
- they reduced some crash surfaces
- they got us from "fleet chaos" to "specific transport blocker"

What they did **not** accomplish:

- they did not make `central=true + power=true` trustworthy on the wall ESP8266 devices

### Recovery / rollout work accomplished

- `.67` OTA'd from `0.1.29` to `0.1.40`
- `.30` OTA'd from `0.1.29` to `0.1.40`
- `.225` OTA'd from `0.1.39` to `0.1.40`
- `.225` had `power.enabled=false` enforced before reboot/OTA stabilization
- wall devices were recovered entirely over LAN, no reopening required

### OTA tooling fix accomplished

`scripts/qa-ota-stress.ps1` was improved so it no longer misclassifies a reboot-cutoff
OTA as failure when the device clearly accepted the image and came back.

This matters because earlier tooling noise made rollout confidence worse than it needed to be.

## Exact Tested Combinations and Current Confidence

### High confidence

1. `central=true, power=false` on wall ESP8266 devices
   - currently the best available **safer** mode
   - not yet good enough to declare fleet-wide long-run stability

2. `central=false, power=true` on isolated testing
   - indicates power telemetry alone is not the entire issue

3. `.48` as a bench/control device
   - central and power together are more workable there than on the wall devices

### Lower confidence / not trusted

1. `central=true, power=true` on low-heap wall ESP8266 devices
   - still considered blocked

2. Long-run interpretation of `reset_reason=Exception`
   - many devices still show this, so we cannot yet claim the underlying reset source
     is fully understood or eliminated

3. Fleet-wide long-run stability even in the safer mode
   - 2026-05-19 short watches show that at least `.69`, `.30`, and `.225`
     are still rebooting in `power=false`

## Where Firmware Owns Delays / Slowdowns

This is deliberately candid.

### 1. Stayed in firmware-only mitigation mode too long

I spent too long trying to "win" with local heap shaving and pacing changes,
even after the evidence started pointing toward a transport/contract issue that
needed hub-team collaboration.

Those firmware changes were useful narrowing work, but the escalation to a shared
design problem should have happened sooner.

### 2. Sometimes reported a gate failure before fully converting it into the next decisive step

I eventually recovered the thread and kept pushing, but there were moments where
I stopped at "not ready" before extracting the next concrete hypothesis or path.

That created drag and could have been more decisive.

### 3. Wall-device constraints changed how aggressively I could experiment

Once devices were back in the wall, any change with a significant risk of requiring
serial recovery had to be treated differently.

That was the correct operational choice, but it slowed the debugging loop.

### 4. Observability is still weaker than ideal on the exact Exception source

We have enough evidence to know the general failure surface, but not enough to
explain every reset in a satisfying, root-cause-complete way.

## What Is Currently Blocking Continued Progress

The biggest blockers now are:

### A. Constrained-device power ingest contract

Firmware alone is unlikely to solve this cleanly.

We need a better contract for low-heap devices than:

- normal central behavior
- plus a second standalone HTTPS power upload transaction

### A2. Residual reboot instability even with `power=false`

The new short watches show that:

- `.67` held through the watch window
- `.69` rebooted during the watch
- `.30` rebooted during the watch
- `.225` entered a repeating short reboot pattern during the watch

So while `power=false` is safer, it is not the full fix.

### B. Same-LAN hub routing model is not explicit enough

There is active concern around devices like:

- `192.168.18.185`

and whether they need:

- `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`

versus:

- a same-LAN internal/private address

I checked both repos:

- firmware defaults to `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
- hub defaults to `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
- hub adoption/announce code builds the register URL from `settings.public_base_url`

That means:

- the defaults are sane
- but a live runtime override (`network.public_base_url` / `REBOOTER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`)
  could still issue the wrong host/route

### C. Wi-Fi fallback behavior is still too static

The current model is not rich enough for resilient field behavior.

It needs a real ordered fallback network list, not just a simplistic primary/secondary
or hard-coded dev fallback mindset.

## Specific Help Requested From Rebooter-Droids

### 1. Help redesign the low-heap power ingest path

This is the top ask.

Please help define and implement a more suitable constrained-device transport.

Candidate directions:

1. Heartbeat piggyback
   - include compact power summary in heartbeat
   - one HTTPS transaction instead of two

2. Lightweight dedicated endpoint
   - smaller schema
   - minimal/no response body
   - designed explicitly for ESP8266-class devices

3. Adaptive policy by device class / health
   - hub controls whether a device is allowed standalone power uploads
   - firmware obeys a constrained/safe mode profile

4. Hub-side backpressure
   - hub signals constrained devices to reduce or disable certain flows

### 2. Help with shared stability / reliability / resiliency design

I need this to become an explicit cross-team design effort.

Areas to collaborate on:

- fewer TLS transactions per cycle on weak devices
- payload budgeting by device class
- stable boot warmup behavior
- clear safe-mode policy
- better transport failure telemetry
- less crash-prone persistence/logging interaction

### 3. Help design configurable ordered Wi-Fi fallback chains

Requested feature direction:

- configurable ordered Wi-Fi candidate list
- not only "primary then AP mode" or "primary + secondary"
- but an ordered list:
  - try network A
  - then B
  - then C
  - etc.

Requested properties:

1. Priority order
2. Hidden-network support
3. Credential storage per candidate
4. Bounded retries and cooldowns
5. Last-known-good preference
6. AP mode only after sensible exhaustion of the list
7. Diagnostics showing which SSIDs were tried and why they failed
8. Hub-side visibility and management, not just local-only config

### 4. Help define correct same-LAN hub routing behavior

For devices on the same LAN as the hub host, we need a supported answer to:

- should they still use the public canonical base?
- should they get a private/internal base URL first?
- should the device hold an ordered list such as:
  - internal/private hub URL
  - `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - `https://www2.voipguru.org/rebooter`

This question is active and practical, not theoretical.

### 5. Help audit live runtime network/public-base settings

Please check:

- `network.public_base_url`
- `REBOOTER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- any DB override on the live hub
- what `central_register_url` is actually being emitted for adopted devices

This matters directly for the `192.168.18.185` concern.

## Firmware Findings on the `www` / bare-domain Concern

This section should save future re-investigation.

### What the code currently does

Firmware side:

- canonical default base URL is `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - [types.h](C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\include\types.h)
- config cleanup also falls back to `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - [config_manager.cpp](C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\src\config_manager.cpp)

Hub side:

- default `public_base_url` is `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - [config.py](C:\dev\rebooter-droids-publish\app\config.py)
- device enrollment instructions show:
  - primary: `https://www.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - secondary: `https://www2.voipguru.org/rebooter`
  - [new.html](C:\dev\rebooter-droids-publish\templates\devices\new.html)
- adoption/announce path builds the device register URL from runtime settings:
  - `settings.public_base_url.rstrip('/') + '/api/v1/device/register'`
  - [announcements.py](C:\dev\rebooter-droids-publish\app\services\announcements.py)

### Interpretation

- The standard code path does **not** casually strip `www`.
- A missing-`www` problem is still possible via live runtime configuration.
- `www.voipguru.org` is not just the preferred public URL form; it is a
  required hostname in environments where dropping `www` changes routing
  behavior or causes the device to resolve/use the wrong path.
- Therefore the right question is:
  - what is the live runtime value of `public_base_url` on the affected hub?

  - sample count: `48`

## Late 2026-05-19 Watch Correction

This section overrides any too-optimistic reading from earlier notes.

### `.225` short watch result

Artifact:

- `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Codex\2026-04-18-all-projets-on-this-windows-pc\watch-225-short-2026-05-19.ndjson`

Observed behavior:

- `.225` stayed reachable
- `.225` remained `central_registered=true`
- `.225` remained `power_enabled=false`
- but `.225` repeatedly rebooted from `boot_warmup`
- observed uptime repeatedly climbed to roughly `~87-89s` then reset to `~5-6s`

Interpretation:

- `.225` is not stable enough yet even in the safer `power=false` mode
- the device is not "offline" in the old sense, but it is still in a recurring
  Exception reboot pattern

### `.67` / `.69` / `.30` comparison watch result

Artifact:

- `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Codex\2026-04-18-all-projets-on-this-windows-pc\watch-67-69-30-short-2026-05-19.ndjson`

Observed behavior:

- `.67` stayed monotonic through the short watch and did not reboot during the window
- `.69` rebooted during the watch
- `.30` rebooted during the watch
- both `.69` and `.30` stayed registered and reachable, but they are not yet
  "boring" devices

Interpretation:

- the fleet is in a better state than when devices were stuck in recovery or
  offline
- but the wall-device stability problem is not solved, only narrowed and partially
  mitigated

### Prior memos / readouts

- Low-heap power upload memo:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\docs\rebooter-droids-low-heap-power-upload-memo-2026-05-17.md`
- Wall stability memo:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\docs\rebooter-droids-wall-device-stability-memo-2026-05-18.md`
- Status/blockers/help-request memo:
  - `C:\dev\rebooter-firmware\docs\2026-05-19-status-blockers-help-request-to-rebooter-droids.md`

## What Is Safe To Do Next

1. Leave wall devices in:
   - `central=true`
   - `power=false`
   while treating this as a mitigation, not a final resolution

2. Use `.48` for any risky bench validation first.

3. Collaborate with hub team on:
   - lightweight power ingest
   - runtime public-base audit
   - same-LAN routing policy
   - Wi-Fi fallback design

4. Treat any attempt to re-enable `power=true` on wall ESP8266 units as experimental
   and not yet production-safe.

## What Not To Do Next

1. Do **not** reopen wall devices unless there is no remote path left.
2. Do **not** broadly re-enable power uploads on wall ESP8266 units yet.
3. Do **not** assume the current `power=false` profile means "stability solved."
4. Do **not** assume the `www` issue is imaginary or already disproven.
   - it is plausible through runtime config even if defaults are correct
5. Do **not** assume `.225` is fully settled just because it registered again.
   - it entered a repeating short reboot loop during this session

## Bottom Line

The project is **not** stuck everywhere.

We have recovered the fleet into a useful remote-managed state.

The current true blocker is narrow and important:

- stable, resilient, hub-connected operation on low-heap ESP8266 wall devices,
  with the power-upload path as the clearest unsafe feature and residual reboot
  instability still present even in the safer profile

The next leap forward should be a shared firmware + hub design effort focused on:

- constrained-device power ingest
- Wi-Fi fallback resiliency
- same-LAN routing clarity
- runtime settings truth
- better observability for recurring Exception resets in the safer profile

This is the point where the right collaboration will save more time than another
round of isolated firmware-local mitigation attempts.
